## How it works

Races the beam! Font is pre generated and loaded into registers. 6 bit colour keeps register count low.

Every minute the colours cycle.

## How to test

Hook up a VGA monitor to the outputs and provide a clock at 31.5 MHz. 

Adjust time with the inputs[2:0], and choose the type of VGA PMOD with the input[3].

## External hardware

VGA PMOD - you can use one of these VGA PMODs:

* https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga
* https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-vga-clock-pmod

Set input[3] low to use tiny-vga and high to use vga-clock
