## How it works

Set a code for your precious safe!
**Controls**
* Pin 1 is used to reset the safe.
* Pin 7 is used to set your code (ON = set, OFF = locked)
* Pins 2 to 4 are used to set the code.
* The clock button is used to enter your code.

## How to test

Set the clock to manual mode.
Set your desired code using pins 2 to 4. Once you've done so, toggle pin 7 to ON, press the clock button then toggle pin 7 back OFF--the safe is now set!
Turn ON pin 1, and press the clock button. The seven segment display should show "L" (for locked).
Next turn OFF pin 1 to begin entering codes.
