## How it works

Debounce the inputs, drive an encoder module, and output a PWM signal for each encoder.

## How to test

Twist each encoder and the LEDs attached to the outputs should change in brightness.

By setting the debug port to 0, 1 or 2, the internal value of each encoder is output on the bidirectional outputs.

## External hardware

Use 3 digital encoders attached to the first 6 inputs.
