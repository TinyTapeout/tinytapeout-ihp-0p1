# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here.
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files:
    - top_tto.v
    - vga.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_tomkeddie_a"

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Simple Game"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      VGA game using paddles attached to input.  No scoring, no diagonal ball movement

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Attach VGA pmod and connect to monitor.  Use the inputs to move the paddles

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - left paddle up
    - left paddle down
    - right paddle up
    - right paddle down
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - pmod sel (high=mole99, low=digilent)
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - r1/r0 (mole99/digilent)
    - g1/r1 (mole99/digilent)
    - b1/r2 (mole99/digilent)
    - vsync/r3 (mole99/digilent)
    - r0/b0 (mole99/digilent)
    - g0/b1 (mole99/digilent)
    - b0/b2 (mole99/digilent)
    - hsync/b3 (mole99/digilent)
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - g0
    - g1
    - g2
    - g3
    - hsync
    - vsync
    - tied low
    - tied low
