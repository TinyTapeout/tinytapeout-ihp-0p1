## How it works

ROM memory that contains information about the Tiny Tapeout chip. The ROM is 8-bit wide and 256 bytes long.

### The ROM layout

The ROM layout is as follows:

| Address | Length | Encoding  | Description                              |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 0       | 8      | 7-segment | Shuttle name (e.g. "tt07"), null-padded  |
| 8       | 8      | 7-segment | Git commit hash                          |
| 32      | 96     | ASCII     | Chip descriptor (see below)              |
| 248     | 4      | binary    | Magic value: `"TT\xFA\xBB"`              |
| 252     | 4      | binary    | CRC32 of the ROM contents, little-endian |

### The chip descriptor

The chip descriptor is a simple null-terminated string that describes the chip.
Each line is a key-value pair, separated by an equals sign. It contains the following keys:

| Key     | Description                   | Example value              |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| shuttle | The identifier of the shuttle | tt07                       |
| repo    | The name of the repository    | TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-07 |
| commit  | The commit hash \*            | a1b2c3d4                   |

\* The commit hash is only included for Tiny Tapeout 5 and later, and is not present on IHP chips.

Here is a complete example of a chip descriptor:

```
shuttle=tt07
repo=TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-07
commit=a1b2c3d4
```

### How the ROM is generated

The ROM is automatically generated by [tt-support-tools](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-support-tools)
while building the final GDS file of the chip. Look at the `rom.py` file in the repository for more details.

## How to test

Read the ROM contents by setting the address pins and reading the data pins.
The first 16 bytes of the ROM are 7-segment encoded and contain the shuttle name and commit hash.
You can read them by toggling the first four DIP switches and observing the on-board 7-segment display.
